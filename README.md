# Cooking_Reminder
Do you keep forgetting your cooking turns while staying with your roommates/friends? Here is the solution for that: python application deployed on Heroku which reminds you about your cooking turn.

1.This python application has predefined weekly roster which defines individual’s cooking turn in a week. The application when executed, determines the date thereby determining day of the week. Then picks up the corresponding email ID for that day from the roster and sends them an email reminding their cooking turns.

2.The python application is deployed on open source cloud platform Heroku. It uses one of the free add-ons ‘Heroku Scheduler’ to trigger the execution of python script every 24 hours.
